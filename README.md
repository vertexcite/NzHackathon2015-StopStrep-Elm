This was for the Fight the Fever team which won the NZ Health Hackathon 2015.
The game concept was a differentiator that helped secure the win.
This demo was an infinitesimal part of their excellent work.

To compile use: `elm-make EmbeddedMain.elm --output elm.js`

Then open `index.html` (e.g. on a Mac use `open index.html`)

Get Elm from [elm-lang.org](elm-lang.org).
