Scratching the surface of the Stop Strep game for kids

Demo available at http://vertexcite.github.io/NzHackathon2015-StopStrep-Elm/

This was for the Fight the Fever team which won the NZ Health Hackathon 2015.
The game concept was a differentiator that helped secure the win.
This demo was an infinitesimal part of their excellent work.
